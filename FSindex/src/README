PFMFind: a system for discovery of peptide homology and function
================================================================

Summary
=======

Protein Fragment Motif Finder (PFMFind) is a system that enables
efficient discovery of relationships between short fragments of
protein sequences using similarity search. It supports queries based
on score matrices and PSSMs obtained through an iterative procedure
similar to PSI-BLAST. PSSM construction is customisable through
plugins written in Python. PFMFind consists of a GUI client, an
algorithm using an index for fast similarity search and a relational
database for storing search results and sequence annotations. It is
written mostly in Python. All components communicate between
themselves using TCP/IP sockets and can be located on different
physical machines.

Documentation
=============

The documentation for PFMFind can be found in the sphinx-docs subdirectory.
It includes detailed installation and setup instructions, in ReST format.
HTML or PDF documentation can be generated from the rst files using Sphinx
Python package.
