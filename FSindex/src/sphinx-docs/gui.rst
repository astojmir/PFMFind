Running GUI client
==================

Starting
--------

The GUI client can be started from the command line using the ``PFMFind.pyw`` script:

$ PFMFind.pyw [--console] [config_file]


The client will contain a Python console (useful for debugging) if the option ``--console`` is set. The ``config_file`` optional argument is the path to an XML file containing the information about the database and the index to be connected. This file can also be specified directly from the GUI.
